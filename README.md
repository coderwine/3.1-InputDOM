**Instructions:**
You will need to **FORK** this repository (repo) to your own account.  After you have forked it to your account, you will then need to **CLONE** that repo to your computer.  By doing this, you will be able to work through the challenges and push your code back to your own repo.  All instructions are within each file.  Below details the instructions for both challenges.

**3.1 Input & DOM Manipulation Challenge**

- Using the html and js files provided, write a webpage that asks the user for input on a store, a quantity, and a product.  
    
    - Save the user input in 3 separate variables. 
        - Once the user has input their information, your webpage should console.log a sentence using those 3 variables. Using dom manipulation, you should also display the user input to the screen. For example: 'I shopped at *Target* for *5* *apples*' may be output to the console & screen. 
        
    - Do not alter the HTML doc.

    - This does not need to be styled in any sort of fashion, but feel free to if you would like!
